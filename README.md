# alchemy-oauth

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/magiclabs/alchemy-oauth.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/magiclabs/alchemy-oauth)

OAuth 2.0 provider that integrates with [Alchemy](https://github.com/magiclabs/alchemy_cms) and provides a user's details via JSON once they logged in.

## Installation

Add the gem to your application's `Gemfile` and run `bundle` afterwards:

```ruby
gem 'alchemy-oauth'
```

Mount the engine in your main application's `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
mount Alchemy::Oauth::Engine => '/oauth'
```

Add the doorkeeper migrations to your app:

```
bundle exec rails g dorkeeper:migrations
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```

## Usage

You should now see a new OAuth navigation item in Alchemy's admin interface. In that interface you can configure which applications may access the user's details. Once the user logged in and the client obtained a valid access_token, the user's details can be accessed at `/<oauth_mount>/user`. In the example that would be `/oauth/user`. A request will return the user's attributes as JSON:

```JSON
{
	"cached_tag_list":"",
	"created_at":"2013-11-06T11:30:19Z",
	"creator_id":null,
	"email":"mail@example.com",
	"firstname":"Firtname",
	"gender":"",
	"id":1,
	"language":"de",
	"last_request_at":"2013-12-03T15:00:46Z",
	"lastname":"Lastname",
	"login":"foobar",
	"roles":["admin"],
	"updated_at":"2013-12-03T15:00:46Z",
	"updater_id":1
}
```

**Note:** regardless of the mountpoint [doorkeeper](https://github.com/applicake/doorkeeper) will *always* prepent it's routes to the main app in the `/oauth` namespace. So even if the engine is mounted at `/api`, the relevant OAuth routes will still only be available at `/oauth`. At the moment the mountpoint changes the `/user` path only.
